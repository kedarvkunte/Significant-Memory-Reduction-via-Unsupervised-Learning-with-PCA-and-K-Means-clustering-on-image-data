# Significant-Memory-Reduction-via-Unsupervised-Learning-with-PCA-and-K-Means-clustering-on-image-data
In this project, unsupervised learning is implemented with the help of python modules such as Numpy, Scipy.

## Principal Component Analysis
The Principal Component Analysis is an algorithm to find the directions that maximize the variance in the data. Data is projected from the actla directions is projected on the aforementioned dimensions.
