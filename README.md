# Significant Memory Reduction via Unsupervised Learning with PCA and K-Means clustering on image data
In this project, unsupervised learning is implemented with the help of python modules such as Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, PIL.



## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
The Principal Component Analysis is an algorithm to find the directions that maximize the variance in the data. Data is projected from the actla directions is projected on the aforementioned dimensions.

## K-Means Clustering Algorithms
In this algorithm, the main aim is to form the cluster and their centroids and assigning each sample in the data to one of these clusters.

## Requirements

* Python 3.5 or higher
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* PIL
* sklearn
